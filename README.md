Welcome to my webpage. I will tell you a bit about myself. I graduated with a medical science bachelor's degree and worked in a hospital right after graduation. 
<br> Five years later, I realized that I do not like what I do. And to be successful at what you do, you have to love it. I turned my interest to software development a year ago, and I started learning from the very basics.
<br>
I am so passionate about this field since I had succeeded in many computer programming events in middle school. I wrote my first lines of code when I was 12 years old. The inspiration I had that time kept me persistent in designing small applications for my computer science teacher, and I build ten different applications while he only asked me to do one. That is from where I realized I wanted to learn programming and software development. <br>
Writing code and cooperating with other developers is now the part of my life that I enjoy the most. I would sincerely want to keep going with the same motivation and spirit beyond what ordinary developers and community members would reach.

# Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is the ability to manage your personal and professional life problems with a more creative and problem-solving way of thinking. The opposite of a growth mindset is the fixed mindset, which leaves people with self-doubt and frustration upon any problem they face. Let us compare these two mindsets from the perspective of different aspects of life:
<br>
* __Challanges__
<br>

If you have a growth mindset, you will think of a challenge as an opportunity to develop your skills and the ability to think more creatively about different problems then solve them with confidence.
<br>
* __Obstacles__
<br>

A fixed mindset believes that obstacles are where you should give up and leave tasks unsolved. In contrast, with a growth mindset, you will break these obstacles and pave the way for your advancement peacefully, focusing on your goals, not the obstacles themselves.
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Three simple reminders to become more productive: <br>
- [x] Remember that "No pain, no gain" and never lose your momentum over any obstacle you face.
- [x] Play big, set goals, and stay disciplined.
- [x] Focus on what is important, then make your actions, and leave all nonsense away.
